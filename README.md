Monty Interpreter

This is a Monty interpreter project, which is designed to execute Monty byte code files. The Monty language is a simple, stack-based programming language.

Overview:
The Monty interpreter is implemented in [programming language]. It reads Monty byte code files and executes the instructions line by line. The interpreter follows the rules and specifications outlined in the Monty language documentation.

Features:
- Executes Monty byte code files
- Supports stack operations such as push, pop, and swap
- Implements arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Handles control flow instructions like jumping and conditional branching
- Supports input/output instructions for reading and writing data
- Implements functions and function calls
- Handles error cases such as invalid instructions or memory allocation failures
- Provides detailed error messages with line numbers for easier debugging

Usage:
To use the Monty interpreter, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile the source code using [compiler command].
3. Run the interpreter by executing the compiled binary and providing the Monty byte code file as an argument.
   Example: ./monty bytecode.m
